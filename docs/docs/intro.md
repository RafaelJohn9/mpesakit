# Introduction ‚Äî Why choose MpesaKit

MpesaKit is a focused SDK that wraps M-Pesa APIs, validation, and common workflows so teams can integrate mobile money quickly and reliably. This intro explains what MpesaKit saves you, how it helps, and why it‚Äôs a practical choice for shipping payments functionality with confidence.

## What MpesaKit does for you

MpesaKit bundles:

- API clients for common M-Pesa endpoints (payments, reversals, reconciliation, webhooks) üõ†Ô∏è
- Input and response validation to catch errors early
- Helpers for authentication, retry, and rate-limiting
- Lightweight utilities for serializing requests and parsing responses

In short: it turns a lot of boilerplate, error-prone work into a few well-documented calls.

## Why use MpesaKit (short answer)

- Ship faster: avoid re-implementing auth, validation, and error handling.
- Reduce bugs: validated inputs and consistent response handling cut integration faults.
- Stay consistent: a single, tested library enforces best practices across projects.
- Save engineering time: focus on product logic instead of plumbing.

## What it saves you on

- Time spent learning and wiring raw REST calls and OAuth flows.
- Time debugging inconsistent or malformed payloads.
- Rework caused by edge-case responses and retried requests.
- Documentation drift between teams ‚Äî the SDK acts as living documentation.

## How it helps in practice

- Built-in validation rejects bad requests before they reach M-Pesa, reducing failed transactions.
- Centralized error handling and retries make integrations more resilient to transient failures.
- Webhook helpers make validating, parsing, and acknowledging events straightforward.
- Examples and small utilities reduce onboarding time for new developers.

## Key features at a glance

- Auth management (token refresh, caching)
- Request/response validation
- Payment initiation and query methods
- Webhook handling and verification utilities
- Clear, minimal API surface designed for server-side use

## Who benefits most

- Backend teams building payment flows for apps or web platforms.
- Startups that need a reliable payments integration without hiring specialized payments engineers.
- Engineers who want testable, well-documented tools rather than ad-hoc scripts.

## Getting started (quick)

1. Install MpesaKit into your project.
2. Configure credentials and environment (sandbox/production).
3. Use the provided client to initiate or query payments and accept webhooks.

A typical flow becomes: configure client üîß ‚Üí validate input  ‚Üí call SDK method ‚ö° ‚Üí handle structured response .

## Final note üìå

MpesaKit exists to make M-Pesa integrations predictable and maintainable. If the goal is to move fast while keeping payments code safe and testable, MpesaKit reduces friction and risk so teams can focus on the product.
